# scale-repos

OSM > Scale Repos is intended to be a repository of microtonal scales
expressed in supported schemas.

It's intended that by putting a microtonal scale repo in Github, programatic
access is facilitated.

The repo is name-spaced by the application that generated the files, so
their products can be included without collision of files.  For example, The
ROSM (Ruby Object Scale Model) library, supports SCL, YAML and JSON
formats.  Its files are located under "rosm"
